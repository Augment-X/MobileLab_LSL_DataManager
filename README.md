# MobileLab_LSL_DataManager
In this project we made an extension on the excisting data manager. The data mmanager still run on an end point computing device. However in this instance, the data manager is linked to an application on a phone.  
Using a (Android / Iphone) application, a user is able to monitor, record and visualise LSL streams on a phone application. 

In addition the phone app allows you to flag certain events. three push buttens andone latching button can be used for this. 

Two repos are availebme: One for the phone app and one for the modified data manager.
